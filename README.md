# Brewery Discovery

## Description

Discover your local breweries through the Brewery Discovery web app. This web app showcases a list of local breweries throughout the United States. Users are first met with a homepage dashboard that lists all the breweries inside the database. They can either search for a specific brewery or use the integrated map feature. Once a user clicks on the brewery they are brought to the breweries profile where they can view a list of their beers.

## Learning Goals

- Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship on the backend, with full CRUD actions
- Have at least two different client-side routes using React Router
- Implement authentication/authorization, with password protection
